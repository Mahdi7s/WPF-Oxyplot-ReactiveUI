# WPF-Oxyplot-ReactiveUI

A WPF application, which allows you to load data files that contain pairs of x and y values and display them on a graph. Once a file has been loaded, the user should be able to select one of the following fitting models: linear, exponential, or power function. The user should then be able to fit the data via the fit model chosen. The fitted coefficients should be displayed on the screen and the fitted curve should be displayed on the graph along with the loaded data points.
